abstract: Building accurate Deep Learning (DL) models for brain age prediction is
  a very relevant topic in neuroimaging, as it could help better understand neurodegenerative
  disorders and find new biomarkers. To estimate accurate and generalizable models,
  large datasets have been collected, which are often multi-site and multi-scanner.
  This large heterogeneity negatively affects the generalization performance of DL
  models since they are prone to overfit site-related noise. Recently, contrastive
  learning approaches have been shown to be more robust against noise in data or labels.
  For this reason, we propose a novel contrastive learning regression loss for robust
  brain age prediction using MRI scans. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
  on the OpenBHB challenge, yielding the best generalization capability and robustness
  to site-related noise.
