abstract: 'In this paper we present several methods to identify precursors that show
  great promise for early predictions of solar flare events. A data preprocessing
  pipeline is built to extract useful data from multiple sources, Geostationary Operational
  Environmental Satellites and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic
  Imager (HMI), to prepare inputs for machine learning algorithms. Two classification
  models are presented: classification of flares from quiet times for active regions
  and classification of strong versus weak flare events. We adopt deep learning algorithms
  to capture both spatial and temporal information from HMI magnetogram data. Effective
  feature extraction and feature selection with raw magnetogram data using deep learning
  and statistical algorithms enable us to train classification models to achieve almost
  as good performance as using active region parameters provided in HMI/Space-Weather
  HMI-Active Region Patch (SHARP) data files. Case studies show a significant increase
  in the prediction score around 20 hr before strong solar flare events.'
