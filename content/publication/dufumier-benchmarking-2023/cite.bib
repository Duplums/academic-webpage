 abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) and speciﬁcally CNN models have become a de facto method for a wide range of vision tasks, outperforming traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Consequently, they drew a lot of attention in the neuroimaging ﬁeld in particular for phenotype prediction or computer-aided diagnosis. However, most of the current studies often deal with small single-site cohorts, along with a speciﬁc pre-processing pipeline and custom CNN architectures, which make them difﬁcult to compare to. We propose an extensive benchmark of recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D CNN, evaluating also the beneﬁts of data augmentation and deep ensemble learning, on both Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) pre-processing and minimally preprocessed quasi-raw images. Experiments were conducted on a large heterogeneous multi-site 3D brain anatomical MRI data-set comprising N = 10k scans on 3 challenging tasks: age prediction, sex classiﬁcation, and schizophrenia diagnosis. We found that all models provide signiﬁcantly better predictions with VBM images than quasi-raw data. This ﬁnding evolved as the training set approaches 10k samples where quasi-raw data almost reach the performance of VBM. Moreover, we showed that linear models perform comparably with SOTA CNN on VBM data. We also demonstrated that DenseNet and tiny-DenseNet, a lighter version that we proposed, provide a good compromise in terms of performance in all data regime. Therefore, we suggest to employ them as the architectures by default. Critically, we also showed that current CNN are still very biased towards the acquisition site, even when trained with N = 10k multi-site images. In this context, VBM pre-processing provides an efﬁcient way to limit this site effect. Surprisingly, we did not ﬁnd any clear beneﬁt from data augmentation techniques - and more recently proposed MRI artefacts for brain MRI. Finally, we also showed that big CNN models were not well calibrated when trained with small brain MRI data-sets and we empirically proved that deep ensemble learning is well suited to re-calibrate them without sacriﬁcing performance.},
