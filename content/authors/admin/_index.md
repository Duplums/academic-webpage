      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a researcher in machine learning at the GAIA Lab in NeuroSpin (CEA Saclay). My current research includes self-supervised representation learning applied to brain data (functional and anatomical), multimodal deep learning with a focus on information theory. Ultimately, I am interested in discovering new brain biomarkers underpinning mental disorders.
I was a postdoc researcher advised by Jean-Philippe Thiran at EPFL. Before that, I obtained my PhD in computer science from the Université Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Edouard Duchesnay, Pietro Gori and Arthur Tenenhaus.
