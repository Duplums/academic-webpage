abstract: Recent advances in machine learning applied to structural magnetic resonance
  imaging (sMRI) may highlight abnormalities in brain anatomy associated with mental
  disorders. These disorders are multifactorial, resulting from a complex combination
  of neurodevelopmental and environmental factors. In particular, such factors are
  present in cortical sulci, whose shapes are determined very early in brain development
  and are a valuable proxy for capturing specifically the neurodevelopmental contribution
  of brain anatomy. This paper explores whether the shapes of cortical sulci can be
  used for diagnosis prediction using deep learning models. These models are applied
  to three mental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia)
  in large multicentric datasets. We demonstrate that the neurodevelopmental underpinnings
  of these disorders can be captured with sMRI. Finally, we show the potential of
  visual explanations of models’ decisions in discovering biomarkers for mental disorders.
