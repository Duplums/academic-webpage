abstract: 'Contrastive Learning has shown impressive results on natural and medical
  images, without requiring annotated data. However, a particularity of medical images
  is the availability of meta-data (such as age or sex) that can be exploited for
  learning representations. Here, we show that the recently proposed contrastive y-Aware
  InfoNCE loss, that integrates multi-dimensional meta-data, asymptotically optimizes
  two properties: conditional alignment and global uniformity. Similarly to [33],
  conditional alignment means that similar samples should have similar features, but
  conditionally on the meta-data. Instead, global uniformity means that the (normalized)
  features should be uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere, independently
  of the meta-data. Here, we propose to deÔ¨Åne conditional uniformity, relying on the
  meta-data, that repel only samples with dissimilar metadata. We show that direct
  optimization of both conditional alignment and uniformity improves the representations,
  in terms of linear evaluation, on both CIFAR-100 and a brain MRI dataset.'
