abstract: 'Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for
  detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most
  predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been
  shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer’s Disease.
  Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning
  settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with
  data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information
  of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning
  good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work,
  we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages
  anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves
  stateof-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate
  our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different
  conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.
  Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores
  using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information
  during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained
  models can be found at: https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/AnatCL.'
